# Project: Exitbot

Exit Group is a fraternal organization dedicated to ending reliance on corporate employment. To assist with the efforts to connect like-minded individuals, we created this AI chatbot to retrieve a list of members with similar interests and goals.

## Description

In-depth paragraph

### Creating Fake Profiles

* We used Llama 2 AI chatbot to create 100 profiles of same Exit members that included Interests, Expertise, Ambition, Location, and other Notes.
* These profiles were created in specific genres that included business and technology interests, outdoors enthusiasts, sports fan, and other types of potential Exit members.

### Embedding Profiles and Finding Ranked Matches

* Imported the file of profiles and combined all attributes except Name to create one large 'About' column
* Created an option to input a search prompt and return the list of users ranked as closest match being closest to 1
* The prompt really only works when using keywords that are present in the About column. It gets confused with conversational language.
